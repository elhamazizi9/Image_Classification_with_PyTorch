# Image_Classification_with_PyTorch

Image Classification is a fundamental task that attempts to assign an image to a class. The goal is to classify the image by assigning it to a specific label.
Since very begining of this process, CIFAR10 has been known to be a good dataset. I have used this dataset and trained it with PYTorch.
